varienceTest.py:

Varience in poker is defined as the upswings and downswings that a player can expect in their game.
In its most simple form, variance is attributed to luck. Poker is majorly based on chance, and hence one cannot expect to win all the time.
Even with the best starting hand in the game (two aces), one can only expect to win the hand 85.2% of the time (every 4 out of 5).
This program is designed to demonstrate a very basic form of variance; the difference between how often you receive either two aces or two
kings compared to the amount you can expect to receive them (1 in every 220 hands on average for each).

This is calculated by virtually dealing thousands of hands and then recording each time the player receives a hand that has been specified.
The program will then perform calculations on the data to produce a value for the long term variance of a player (in receiving Aces or Kings),
the closer this number is to one, the smaller the variance. If the program is run for only a small number of hands we can see that the variance
is very volatile, however as the number of hands dealt is increased the variance will get closer to the expected value (variance â†’ 1).
