This folder contains some of my Python projects. Please note that the 'ring.py' program requires turtlegraphics 
to run successfully and the 'trains.py' program requires a file containing all the relevant information for the trains journey.
If you wish to run these programs and do not know how, please contact me via email: matthennigan1@gmail.com
